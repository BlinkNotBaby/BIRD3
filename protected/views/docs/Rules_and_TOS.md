### General Rules <small>Common Sense</small>
You are expected to act with common decency and show respect to your peers where it is due. Do not harass, pester or beg for attention. If you are told to stop by the individual that feels harassed, or by staff you are to do so – failure to comply will result in a warning.


### Disagreements with Someone <small>Ask a mod for clarity</small>
If you have a disagreement with someone kindly take it to whispers, if you need an outside party to assist ask a moderator – they are there to help you and will do their best to help you with your issue and find a solution. Public disagreements that end up in personal attacks and otherwise disruptive behavior or language will result in a warning.


### Drama <small>Ask a mod for clarity</small>
In case of an incident try to avoid seeking to validate your problems on others for personal relief, nobody wants to be pulled into a situation where it is all about your problems. Try to avoid talking about it in public chats; instead, you can seek out the help of our moderators if you need to talk. If you are offered a chance to talk and decline it, and proceed to bring it up in public chats, you will be warned and summarily shown out of the channel.

Rayth has volunteered to sit and listen to your plights if you feel you need someone to talk to.


### Warning System <small>Ask a mod for clarity</small>
If by chance, we get complaints about an individual or they fail to adhere to the vocal warnings from staff, they will issue a written warning that can result in bans.

First thru third offense results in written warnings.
Fourth offense results in a three day ban.
Fifth offense results in a permanent ban.

All bans are final unless specifically specified by staff.
Any instance of ban avoidance recognized by any of the staff will be treated with another permanent ban.


### Art <small>Ask a mod for clarity</small>
Any art in your profile has to be tagged, or at least source-linked to the artist that drew it. Artists (or owners) may ask staff to remove their art from the site.

Requirements
* Name of Artist
* Source link that provides or leads to the artist’s name/page

Recommendation:
* Name of the character’s owner


### The Lobby <small>Ask a mod for clarity</small>
The Lobby is the very first channel that new users see and we have different rules for The Lobby, unlike the other channels that can be used for their designed purpose and more. We want to avoid sexual and violent roleplay of all kinds in The Lobby, and in case of links to explicit material it has to be tagged with [NSFW] (or the letters) connected in the sentence before it is posted. Failure to comply when asked to stop will result in a Warning, then removal from the chat. Failure to tag will be met with some leniency but repeated offense will result in a Warning.


### Reporting Staff <small>Abuse of power</small>
Sometimes Moderators can step over their bounds too and you aren’t meant to sit there and let them rule over you with a heavy hand, within reason of course. If you feel you have been unfairly treated you can complain about staff as well. Your complaint will be taken into consideration and the rest of the staff will discuss the situation. The offender will have a chance to explain themselves, as will the victim – and a solution will be made there.
