# The City Sa'Eti, by night.

## Please note, this document may change over the time. It contains several information about the view, but not of the actual story of the town!



Imagine you've booked a room within the town's greatest hotel, and it has just become evening and you decided to dress yourself, getting ready to go out an dmeet friends in the wild. But before you do, you actually want to enjoy the city-side view that you paid for - so you step to your window, open it up and push your head outside.

You are greeted by a refreshing cold breeze - not freezing cold, but a soft cold that could easily be forgotten by the warmth of your friends, the feelings or drinks within a bar. First, your view falls towards the great center of the town. it is a town that could best be described as "half-industrial". The roads are not very well build, but the houses look stable and rather modern. There is a lot of nature involved - trees that are put at the center of the streets at some occassions and flowers which are actually put nearby the front entrence of many houses.

The city's center showcases a huge, circular area where no cars or vehicles are allowed - a big passenger zone. And therefore, a lot of stores, caffees and bars are located there. Many of them have outdoor seats as well. One of the shops may make it obvious that it is a hookah pipe bar, as one is put onto it's side wall as a poster. The whole of the circular area - also known as a market place - is luminated by lights that are standing around a spring. Besides those lights standing there and giving their light to the area - as well as all the shop's neon signs - are benches which allow passengers to sit on and just watch the spring, whcih as well as an illumination from the bottom.

A warm feeling may go trough your body as you remember all the great things oyu have experienced at this place - many friends, many drinks...and many money being spent, too. Indeed, you have begun to love this town, feeling as this IS your home.

As you tilt your head to the side, the area outside of the marketplace falls into your view, offering you larger buildings that contain tons of flats where people live - there is also a school, with a schoolyard. A few street lights illuminate the school yard, showing a few benches, and the ground being just the same as for the streets - a bit dusty, lightly covered with sand maybe.

On the right side you may see a similar image, as well as a huge block of buildings surrounded by a wall - this was a factory. It produced computer chips and frames for gadgets. It was also the company that employeed the most of the townfolks - besides all the bars, shops and taverns. Because as you look upwards of the market place, a huge shopping center unveils. It even has a direct pathway towards the market place, allowing easy walking forth and back.

Then suddenly, besides all the happy voices that come to your ear - laughters, screams followed by laughters and the noise of glasses being donk'ed against one another - you also hear the sound of waves...ocean waves. The hotel itself is located at the beach, which mean that at the very edge of your view, you may see parts of the beach - a lot of sand, that marked pathways towards what lied right behind you.

With a smile you move away and close the window, grab your bag, and run to join the awesomeness that waits!!

        - I like how this one offers a very broad view, is dark and yet offers bright views. It shows windows, marks roads and the sky color is pretty dope.

        - Again a very cool picture. BUT its a view from the seaside. So it does not offer a very broad view, since the actual viewing angle is straight flat, instead of diagunal as you'd get from a hotel room.

        - Sadly a bit tiny. But the angle that was chosen here is awesome. It looks really nice and offers a good view at places.

        - Another seaside view. But the colors for the lights and sky are amazing. The tower that was put here, I could see that standing within the factory's area on the right side of the image - just with a different view on it. I like that the town tiself appears bright, whilst its surroundings are dark.

        - This image is a shot from wtihin a hotel room - whose design I also very much like. I will keep this as a bas ereference to my Hotel's image references.
        - Besides from that, the town you see thru the window has a nice color scheme, and demonstrates a good viewing angle from wtihin a hotel room at a higher floor.

        - Another shot from within a hotel room. Good one, sadly very tiny.

        - As the URL suggests - this is the backgroudn that I am urrently using in my development version of the site! I loooove the colors here. I love it blue, and I like how the view is simply broad, but yet you feel like you could stand there yourself. This is probably one of the best reference out of all of them.
- A circular market place

        - Yep, it had to happen; an Apple Inc. reference!
        - In fact, this circle demonstrates my idea very well. Imagine an area just as round as this huge ass circular building, and instead, fill its center with the various shops and taverns, and the outside being a couple of other shops. But its not a closed circle, some of the streets and pathways may go off towards the rest of the town. But yeah, a circular, market place.

        - Another refernce. It shows a bit more of the area abround the big circle.

        - A map view of the circle.
- A factory

        - Indeed, a nice image...just, from the top. I could not find a better one though!
