# Tasks and jobs

All the things that need to be done in the background are organized in this folder.

* Each job is a class.
* Jobs may be combined to a namespace, represented as a folder.
* All jobs are queued via Redis.
* Each job has to return and report progress.
* Jobs are run asynchron by default, but may use blocking calls if required.
