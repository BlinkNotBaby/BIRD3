# Shell

This folder contains ONLY the code related to the shell. This means, only the SSH related stuff goes in here. But also some CLI related material goes in here as well, as we can easily execute the BIRD3 shell locally as well.

* Structure follows the .../App structure, just that this is more about commands than controllers....
* Instead of rendering HTML, we render using `ink` which is basically the HTML for a terminal.
