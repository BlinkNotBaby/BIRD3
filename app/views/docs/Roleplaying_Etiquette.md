# Roleplaying Etiquette <small>The Bible of Role Playing</small>
_What is Role Play?_ Role Play is the act of assuming a role of a persona that is not you, in a world that might not be Earth, with ideals and abilities that might not be relevant or possible! Let us make an example:


> George Arren is a pretty common guy. He goes to school where he’s neither very good or very bad. He has decent family and some friends that he enjoys hanging with. Online, or in tabletop games with friends he is Arren Leokk a Knight in Medieval England under a fair ruler, King Leonard and Queen Beatrice. As a Knight he is a fair swordsman and good on horseback, for he can do neither of those things in real life – being stuck to a wheelchair, for instance – dreaming of something bigger. Role play can offer him that freedom.


That’s just a small hint of what it could be, but I’m not here to give you an introduction how and why, I’m here to talk about interesting characters and Role Playing Etiquette.

## Character creation
Characters can be whatever, it could be a person similar to yourself, a beast on four legs – a mighty dragon or perhaps a sixteen-headed hydra that grows two more heads on the second day of the third moon when all the planets have aligned!

First things first, is to consider what kind of setting you are placing yourself in. There are many types to pick from, from realistic to full on fantasy, in a futuristic, or perhaps a more medieval or even ancient setting. Another thing to think about is whether this is for a public, or an isolated/private role play.

## Public Role Plays
For public Role Plays you have to consider that you are going to meet a lot of people and have to be relatable to all of them, this means that making a super fantastical character might not be the best of choices. Whereas it might be seen as pretentious and it might reward you the common use term of: *Special Snowflake*. Less is often more in these kind of settings, and the more down to earth the character is the more relatable it is too. This isn’t to say you can’t put fantastical elements into it, but keep it balanced.

_What is a special snowflake?_ It is not quite the same as Mary Sue which we will touch on a little later. A special snowflake is a character that is, by all means special. For instance a person that knows everything or has super strength regardless of anything else. Or perhaps a wizard of unlimited power and knowledge that can destroy the moon with the click of a hand or create items out of thin air! These kinds of things don’t usually sit too well with other  players and make it hard for them to relate with the character and that way, their motivation to role play with you in particular wanes considerably.

A *Mary Sue* on the other hand has more to do with personality, it is when you see someone who is idealized. By idealized I mean a character that is perfect, or very predictable at a standpoint where its characteristics are in question.

## Private/Isolated Role Plays
Then we have Private, or Isolated Role Plays. These are Role Plays that you share with one, or a group of people. It is locked for public view, this means that the ones involved are always the one involved unless someone is invited in. Here you only have to cater to the people you role play with, and if they are fine with you going bat shit crazy on the fantastical details then there is little to hold you back! On the other side the details in the private role play isn’t something that anyone outside of it will be able to relate to, so talking about the details of the private RP (role play) in a public RP might cause confusion.

## Getting involved
Now here is the hard part, getting yourself involved in a role play. This is usually an issue in the public RPs and people end up sitting around, writing something about themselves in attempt to get attention, but instead of expecting others to toss you a rope you should go interact with them instead, make your character interesting for them. Inquire about them, get to know them and perhaps they’ll do the same back.

Worst case scenario would be that they’re not interested and want to be left to their own devices, but fear not it is not the end! There are others around that you can interact with, just approach the next group or individual.

## The Etiquette of Actions
Nobody likes someone that doesn’t respect other people’s personal space, or when they lose control over their character. When someone else bypasses their right to react this is considered *powerplay*, or *godmodding*.

_For instance_:

> George’s knight character has caught a thief stealing from the king’s vault and is chasing the thief down the corridor. The thief is small and nimble and the knight has his heavy armour on him. Somehow, despite the added weight he catches up with the thief and picks him up by the collar of his plain shirt.

There are many things to look at here. The issue here isn’t that he caught up with the thief, because for varying reasons he might be really good at running in armour – but rather than he picked the fella up without offering the other player a chance to react to the reaching hand. A better solution does not require a lot of editing

> George’s knight character has caught a thief stealing from the king’s vault and is chasing the thief down the corridor. The thief is small and nimble and the knight has his heavy armour on him. Somehow, despite the added weight he catches up with the thief and __attempts to pick the thief up by the collar of his plain shirt__.

## Describing your character
When you describe a character it is important not to add too many details about one thing. Rule of thumb is usually two adjectives per description, and especially if they both start on the same letter. You don’t have to give every little detail at once either as explaining that he wears a shirt of this colour and a pair of standard jeans go a long way. You can add details to fill your coming posts instead, like for instance if they look at your face you might make note of the scar on your jaw or perhaps the piercing in your tongue that wouldn’t otherwise be so  visible.

## Formatting
This is not something you’ll get immediately, but there are some things I want to stress when you write, and that is not to mix action with dialogue. It is preferable for most if you use “these” (so called double-quotes), or other formatting tools like Italic or Bold so it does not confuse others. The use of paragraphs also make it easier on the eyes to read rather than one big, joined wall of text.

There is a lot more to go through, but you will learn that and find your own style as you go forward, but with these guidelines you are at least prepared and hold the knowledge to go out there and make stories with others... and should you even need help or assistance you can ask Rayth in chat, or send me and email at Rayth.vehren@gmail.com and I will help you as much as I can.
